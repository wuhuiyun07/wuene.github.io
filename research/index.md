## Research

We are driving the Pediatrics Precision Medicine Initiative for the Department of Pediatrics, and support clinical translational research for the Center for Heme Malignancies at MSK.

We benefit from a fully resourced computational and research environment. We have access to state-of-the-art computing and laboratory facilities to support truly ambitious and innovative research.
