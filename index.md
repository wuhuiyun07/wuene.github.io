We conduct research at three levels. Firstly we apply **molecular microbiology methods** to detect microbial waterborne pathogens to characterize temporal and spatial variations of pathogens in water systems. We use advanced sequencing techniques to study microbiome in natural water and built water as a framework for the health of human, animals, and the environment. Such big data derived analysis, enable us to identify pathogens, novel microbial water indicators, or bacterial phages that can potentially combat antimicrobial resistant crisis.  

These studies empower our second level research. We use environmental metagenomic data to **characterize microbiome in environmental waters, identify waterborne disease associated, reduce the health risks to the environment and human**. We use machine learning for microbiome discovery, espcially viruse communities in environmental water samples.

Last, we perform our research based on **Open Science and reproducible research principle**. We profile temporally as well as spatially separated samples (diagnosis, pre-treatment, post treatment) to quantify changing clonal phylogenies, during disease progression, or in response to therapeutic intervention.

Our aim is to enhance resilience to water quality stresses due to climate change, promote water reuse, engage communities, and explore interdisciplinary fields like machine learning and environmental bioinformatics to mitigate the impacts of merging waterborne microbial pollutants.

We benefit from a fully resourced computational and research environment at Washington State University. We have access to state-of-the-art computing and laboratory facilities to support truly ambitious and innovative research.

We like to perform ambitious research, but operate in a fun, collaborative, and team-oriented environment, and we are strongly committed to mentoring young scientists and engineers through internal and international internship schemes.

**Join us:** We are looking for inspiring, motivated individuals to join our team, challenge our current understanding of cancer biology and help make new discoveries that will inform cancer care and improve patient outcomes.
